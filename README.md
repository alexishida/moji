# Moji

Clean desktop app for opening, reading, editing, and exporting Markdown files. Built with Electron, React, TypeScript, and electron-vite.

## Name

**Moji (文字)** significa literalmente "letra", "caractere" ou "escrita" em japonês.

## Features

- **Open Markdown files**: supports `.md` and `.markdown` through file dialog, drag and drop, CLI/file association entry points, and single-instance forwarding.
- **Multi-document workspace**: horizontal tabs, dirty markers, close buttons, duplicate-file detection, and unsaved-change confirmation.
- **Preview mode**: sanitized Markdown rendering with headings anchors, outline navigation, tables, task lists, linkify, typographer, and syntax-highlighted code.
- **Editor mode**: CodeMirror 6 Markdown editor with line numbers, history, wrapping, and save/save as flows.
- **Export mode**: export the active document as HTML, PDF, or PNG. PDF supports A4, Letter, Legal, portrait, and landscape.
- **Settings view**: centered in-workspace panel for language and preview typography controls.
- **Markdown themes**: dark/light toggle for rendered Markdown and exported output. App chrome remains dark.
- **Internationalization**: English, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish. Initial language follows the OS when possible and user choice is persisted.
- **Security**: sandboxed renderer, context isolation, `nodeIntegration: false`, DOMPurify sanitization, and external links opened in the OS browser.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (developed on Node 22)
- npm

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Useful scripts:

- `npm run dev`: launch Electron with hot reload.
- `npm run typecheck`: run TypeScript checks without emitting files.
- `npm run build`: build main, preload, and renderer into `out/`.
- `npm run preview`: run the built app preview.

## Packaging

```bash
npm run dist
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:linux
```

Artifacts are written to `release/`.

Current packaging targets:

- Windows: NSIS installer, x64.
- Linux: AppImage and deb.

File associations for `.md` and `.markdown` are declared in `electron-builder.yml`.
