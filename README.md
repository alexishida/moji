## Name

**Moji (文字)** literally means "letter", "character", or "writing" in Japanese. Short and easy to remember, it evokes characters and writing. The name fits its purpose: opening, editing, previewing, and exporting Markdown smoothly—without distractions.

## Features

- **Open Markdown files**: supports `.md` and `.markdown` through file dialog, drag and drop, CLI/file association entry points, and single-instance forwarding.
- **Multi-document workspace**: horizontal tabs, dirty markers, close buttons, duplicate-file detection, and unsaved-change confirmation with clear action icons.
- **Tab management**: close other tabs, tabs to the right, saved tabs, or all tabs from the document tab menu.
- **Preview mode**: sanitized Markdown rendering with heading anchors, outline navigation, tables, task lists, footnotes, definition lists, subscript/superscript, highlight/insert marks, emoji shortcodes, LaTeX math via KaTeX (`$…$` and `$$…$$`), linkify, typographer, syntax-highlighted code, and copy buttons for code blocks.
- **Mermaid diagrams**: every valid fenced `mermaid` block supported by bundled Mermaid renders as a responsive diagram, including flowcharts, sequence, Gantt, class, ER, state, and journey diagrams. Click a diagram to inspect it in a modal with zoom, drag navigation, a minimap, and individual PNG export; malformed diagrams remain readable code blocks.
- **Outline navigation**: collapsible heading tree with scroll-spy that highlights the heading nearest the viewport top, plus smooth scroll-to-heading on click and anchor links.
- **Search and replace**: top-bar search highlights matches in preview/editor, shows occurrence count, jumps to the next match, and replaces one match or all matches in the active document.
- **Editor mode**: CodeMirror 6 Markdown editor with line numbers, history, wrapping, localized untitled document names, Markdown formatting shortcuts, and save/save as flows.
- **Export mode**: export the active document as HTML, PDF, or PNG. PDF supports A4, Letter, Legal, portrait, and landscape; long code lines wrap in PDF and PNG exports.
- **Diagram exports**: rendered Mermaid diagrams are embedded as self-contained SVG in HTML, PDF, and PNG exports.
- **Settings view**: centered in-workspace panel for language, preview typography, and a localized shortcut reference.
- **About view**: in-workspace panel showing app name, version (from `package.json`), author, repository link, and the story behind the name.
- **Markdown guide**: bundled localized reference documents (`samples/markdown-guide.<locale>.md`) opened from the status bar.
- **Recent files**: Welcome screen shows recently opened Markdown files and lets you reopen or remove entries.
- **Remembered app state**: window size/position, recent files, last used folder, language, preview typography, and Markdown preview theme are persisted in user settings.
- **Automatic updates**: installed Windows NSIS and Linux AppImage builds check GitHub Releases, show download progress, and restart only after protecting unsaved documents.
- **Markdown themes**: dark/light toggle for rendered Markdown. App chrome remains dark; exports always use the light theme.
- **Internationalization**: English, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Russian. Initial language follows the OS when possible and user choice is persisted.
- **Security**: sandboxed renderer, context isolation, `nodeIntegration: false`, DOMPurify sanitization, and external links opened in the OS browser.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: common file, search, replace, tab, preview, export, fullscreen, and font-size actions; Settings lists every available shortcut.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (developed on Node 22)
- npm

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Useful scripts:

- `npm run dev`: launch Electron with hot reload.
- `npm run typecheck`: run TypeScript checks without emitting files.
- `npm run build`: build main, preload, and renderer into `out/`.
- `npm run preview`: run the built app preview.

## Packaging

```bash
npm run dist
npm run dist:win
npm run dist:linux
```

Artifacts are written to `release/`.

Current packaging targets:

- Windows: NSIS installer, x64, with automatic updates.
- Linux: AppImage with automatic updates, plus deb for manual installation.

File associations for `.md` and `.markdown` are declared in `electron-builder.yml`.

### Publishing a release

1. Update `version` in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
2. Commit changes, then create and push matching tag such as `v0.2.0`.
3. `.github/workflows/release.yml` validates tag, builds Windows first, then Linux, and publishes draft artifacts.
4. Workflow makes GitHub Release public only after NSIS/AppImage binaries and `latest.yml`/`latest-linux.yml` are uploaded.

`electron-updater` runs only in packaged Windows NSIS builds and Linux AppImages. Development and deb builds do not self-update. AppImage must live in a user-writable directory to be replaced successfully. Windows production releases should use an Authenticode certificate through electron-builder signing environment variables; never store certificate credentials in repository.
